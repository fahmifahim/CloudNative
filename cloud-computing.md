# Cloud Computing  
### What is Cloud Computing?  
=> delivery model of computing services, servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more, over the internet or a dedicated link. This is referred to as "the cloud".  


Good quote for Cloud:  
- "While migrating existing apps to VMs is a good start, the cloud is more than just a different place to run VMs."  
- In an on-premises datacenter, you own the whole stack and data. When you migrate them to the Cloud, some responsibilities transfer to the Cloud Provider. You need to determine which part should go to Cloud and which not.
